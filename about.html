    <h1>MEvsREPS: Holding Elected Officials Accountable to You—Every Vote, Every Term</h1>

    <p><strong>MEvsREPS</strong> was thrown together in a couple days as a way for the citizens to express how they wished their representative to vote. 
      The vision is not to take a side but to hear the will of the people on an issue that will directly affect them. It was missing a lot of features 
      that with the time constraints could not be implemented in time. It still is missing those features but working on applying them..</p>

    <p>The issue remains: <strong>once in office, too many politicians vote their conscience, their party, or their donors—rarely the clear will of their constituents.</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; color:#e74c3c; font-size:1.1em;">
        MEvsREPS exists to fix that.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>To make every representative’s voting record transparent, measurable, and directly comparable to the expressed preferences of the people 
      they serve—throughout their entire term, not just on Election Day.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>You Speak</strong><br>
            Constituents in every district answer simple, issue-specific polls: <em>How should your representative vote on each agenda item?</em><br>
            Polls are short, and open as soon as the agenda item(s) becomes available.</li>
        <li><strong>They Vote</strong><br>
            We track the official roll-call vote of every representative.</li>
        <li><strong>We Compare</strong><br>
            A clear <strong>Constituent Alignment Score</strong> (0–100%) shows exactly how often each representative voted with the majority preference of their district.</li>
        <li><strong>You Hold Them Accountable</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time dashboards</li>
                <li>Lifetime voting records</li>
                <li>Side-by-side comparisons</li>
                <li>Shareable report cards</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;"><em>No spin. No editorials. Just <strong>your voice vs. their vote</strong>.</em></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A representative can’t claim “I’m listening to my district” without proof.</li>
        <li>Voters see <em>before</em> the next election whether their rep ignored them on the issues</li>
        <li>Candidates campaign on their alignment score like a job performance review.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This isn’t about left or right. Did your rep vote the will of the people?</strong></p>
